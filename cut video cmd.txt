How to trim video and add fade in effect to its audio using ffmpeg in android studio?

To trim a video and add a fade-in effect to its audio using ffmpeg in Android Studio, you can use the following command:

javascript
Copy code
String[] cmd = {"-i", "input.mp4", "-ss", "00:00:10", "-to", "00:00:20", "-vf", "fade=in:0:30", "-af", "afade=t=in:ss=0:d=3", "-c:v", "copy", "-c:a", "aac", "-b:a", "256k", "output.mp4"};
Here is a breakdown of the command:

-i: Specifies the input file.
-ss: Specifies the start time of the trimmed video.
-to: Specifies the end time of the trimmed video.
-vf: Specifies the video filter. fade=in:0:30 creates a fade-in effect for the video.
-af: Specifies the audio filter. afade=t=in:ss=0:d=3 creates a fade-in effect for the audio. ss specifies the start time of the fade-in effect, and d specifies the duration.
-c:v: Specifies the video codec. copy copies the video codec from the input file.
-c:a: Specifies the audio codec. aac specifies the AAC audio codec.
-b:a: Specifies the audio bitrate. 256k specifies a bitrate of 256 kbps.
output.mp4: Specifies the output file.
To execute this command in Android Studio, you can use the following code:

String[] cmd = {"-i", "input.mp4", "-ss", "00:00:10", "-to", "00:00:20", "-vf", "fade=in:0:30", "-af", "afade=t=in:ss=0:d=3", "-c:v", "copy", "-c:a", "aac", "-b:a", "256k", "output.mp4"};

try {
    FFmpeg.execute(cmd);
} catch (FFmpegCommandAlreadyRunningException e) {
    // Handle the exception
}
This code assumes that you have already set up FFmpeg in your Android Studio project. If you haven't, you can refer to the FFmpeg documentation for Android to learn how to do it.
